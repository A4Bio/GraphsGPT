This is a modified version of [Molecular Sets (MOSES)](https://github.com/molecularsets/moses) for portability and minimal implementation. 

Changes include:

1. Cleaned the codes for training & evaluating built-in models, which makes it compatible with the latest versions of Python (>=3.10).
2. Fixed the [compatibility issue](https://github.com/molecularsets/moses/pull/111) with the latest versions of Pandas (>=2.2.2).
